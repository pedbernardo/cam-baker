# Usage
Camunda Baker can be used to start a new project or into existing projects. The main idea is to use a separate project, exclusively for the forms.

## Creating new projects

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
$ npm create baker
```

```sh [yarn]
$ yarn create baker
```

```sh [pnpm]
$ pnpm create baker
```

## Existing projects

```sh [npm]
$ npm install -D cam-baker
```

```sh [yarn]
$ yarn add -D cam-baker
```

```sh [pnpm]
